Entry REEdirect is an ExpressionEngine extension that allows you to control, on a per-weblog basis, where authors land after publishing or updating entries in the ExpressionEngine control panel.

For each weblog you have four redirect location options for both **new entries** and **updated entries**:

- **Default Preview** - EE's built-in success screen with ugly entry preview
- **Publish Form** - new entry screen for the same weblog you just published to
- **Edit Entry** - keep editing the entry you just published or updated
- **Manage Entries** - the Edit tab, filtered to display entries from the weblog you just published to

In all cases the author will see a "success" message for their new entry or update, and on the **Publish Form** and **Manage Entries** screens will see the entry's title and an "Edit this entry" link.

The Extension Settings screen offers optional one-click setting of all of your weblogs to the same option for both new entries and updated entries. (This feature requires that jQuery for the Control Panel be installed, loading jQuery 1.3 or newer.)

Entries submitted via SAEFs will be be unaffected by this extension.

Entry REEdirect has been tested on ExpressionEngine 1.6.8.
